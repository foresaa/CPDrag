# Power BI QA Metrics and CP Drag Calculator Preview

<img src="perpop.png" alt="Andel Projects Limited" width="400">

This repository provides tools for enhancing project quality assurance (QA) and critical path drag (CP Drag) analysis in **Microsoft Project (MSP)**. The solution includes two key Power BI files:

1. **Power BI QA Template (`.pbit`)**: A reusable template designed for conducting QA checks on Microsoft Project files.
2. **Power BI QA + CP Drag (`.pbix`)**: A preview of how CP Drag metrics from the add-in integrate into the Power BI QA dashboard.

---

## **Files Included**

### **1. QA Template (`QA_Metrics_Template.pbit`)**

The `.pbit` file is a Power BI template specifically designed for performing quality assurance checks on MSP schedules.

#### **Features**

- Automated QA checks, such as:
  - Tasks missing dependencies.
  - Milestones with non-zero durations.
  - Resource overallocations or underallocations.
  - Tasks with negative float.
- Predefined visuals for:
  - QA metrics summaries.
  - Detailed task and resource-level insights.
- Fully customizable parameters for connecting to different MSP files.

#### **How to Use**

1. Open the `.pbit` file in Power BI.
2. When prompted, provide the file path to your **Microsoft Project (.mpp)** file.
3. The template will extract and analyze QA metrics, displaying results in an intuitive dashboard.

### **2. QA + CP Drag Preview (`QA_CP_Drag_Preview.pbix`)**

This `.pbix` file showcases the integration of **CP Drag metrics** generated by the upcoming CP Drag Calculator Add-In. It combines QA checks with advanced critical path drag analysis to provide a holistic view of project health.

#### **Features**

- Includes all QA metrics from the QA Template.
- Previews CP Drag metrics, such as:
  - Drag Working Days and Drag Elapsed Days for critical tasks.
  - Drag Cost and Drag Benefit for financial analysis.
  - Parallel tasks contributing to critical path drag.
- Combined dashboards showing QA and CP Drag insights together.

#### **How to Use**

1. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI.
2. Connect to the provided example dataset (or your own MSP data, if configured).
3. Explore how CP Drag metrics enhance traditional QA checks.

## **Key Benefits**

### **For QA Metrics**

- **Accessibility**: Enables QA checks without requiring deep MS Project expertise.
- **Automation**: Reduces manual effort with prebuilt measures and dashboards.
- **Scalability**: Works for single projects or multiple projects in a portfolio.

### **For CP Drag Integration**

- **Enhanced Insights**: Combines QA metrics with CP Drag data for a complete project analysis.
- **Proactive Decision-Making**: Helps identify and address the most impactful delays.
- **Portfolio-Level Analysis**: Aggregates CP Drag metrics across projects for strategic insights.

## **About the CP Drag Add-In**

The **CP Drag Calculator Add-In** is an advanced tool for calculating and visualizing **Critical Path Drag** directly within MS Project. This add-in enables project managers to:

- Identify tasks contributing the most to project delays.
- Quantify the cost and time impact of critical path tasks.
- Optimize project schedules by focusing on high-drag tasks.

While the add-in is currently in development, the Power BI integration ensures users can preview its powerful insights alongside QA metrics.
